### Auto Ally
a tool for comparing cars & finding helpful info when buying a used car! 

This is a React.JS project for Module 2 of the [Get Coding Program](https://www.getcoding.ca/).  The purpose of this project was to develop a platform that would help beginner car buyers go through the used car buying process with confidence and knowledge!! It evolved over the course of the development but overall I'm pretty happy with how it turned out!

This project wouldn't have been possible without the [Cars API](https://rapidapi.com/hub) I used and I am so grateful for having been able to access their free version! 

Also big thanks to [Chakra UI](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/) as I used various components/icons/styling in order to make this page what I wanted it to be!

Love this [super adorable gif](https://dribbble.com/shots/4339853-Car-Loader) and appreciate it's online access 

And last but not least - biggest thanks to my amazing mentor / instructor [Hai Nghiem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haiphunghiem/) through the [Get Coding Program](https://www.getcoding.ca/) 

If you made it this far - thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy my lil project!!
